## Welcome to our project â€“ proudly built by Prajwal!
<br>Hereâ€™s a quick guide to get you started:

1. This app comes with two dashboards â€“ one for Admins and one for Employees.
2. To access the Employee Dashboard, youâ€™ll first need to create an employee account using an email and password.
3. Log in to the Admin Panel using the credentials below, go to the "Create Member" tab, and add a new employee account.
4. Admin Login Credentials:<br>
    Email: praj@admin.com <br>
    Password: admin123
5. Once you've created an employee, simply log out of the Admin Panel and log in with the new employee credentials. 
6. From there, feel free to explore the app and make the most of it!
